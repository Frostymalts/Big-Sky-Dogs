The dogs are able to move freely from inside to out as long as the weather permits us to leave their doggy doors open.The building is also equipped with large windows and skylights to provide the dogs with fresh air and natural light. All kennels are sanitized daily and routinely spot checked throughout the day. Each kennel has an individual drain to prevent any cross contamination. Your dog will also be provided an elevated bed to keep him off the floor while he sleeps. Soothing music is played throughout the building 24 hours a day to help create a calming atmosphere.</h3>

Because of this, he will only train a maximum of 10 Gun Dogs at any given time. Your dog must be at least 6 months of age to enroll in the program.</h3>
