				<p class="text-justify lead">Big Sky Dog Training was established in 2004. Owner and operator, Marty Golden, is a certified canine trainer behavior specialist who received his education at Triple Crown Dog Academy just outside Austin, Texas. Marty's education allowed him to acquire hands on training with many different breeds of dogs and their owners. He was privileged enough to work one on one with some of the top trainers in the world, including Jessy Gabriel, Rob Dunn and Rody Best. After graduating at the top of his class, Marty earned the right to work as an apprentice at Triple Crown Dog Academy. This gave him the opportunity to live at the academy for another seven months working in the gun dog department where his love for the sport began. In the fall of 2003, Marty returned to Billings, Montana and established Big Sky Dog Training Inc. For the next four years, he worked rigorously with owners and their dogs to modify behavior and improve communication. In 2007 Marty expanded his business and built a boarding and training facility  just outside the city of Billings. The training grounds are on ten acres and include a large pond with a 2,000 sq ft kennel building. This environment has given Marty the ability to focus more on each dogs individual needs as well as a fantastic location for owners to board their dogs while they are out of town.</p>
